# EDX FE Bootcamp Challenge Two: My First Portfolio

## The Task

The task for the second module was to create a portfolio using the CSS methods that we have learned in this method.
This included CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox and Media Queries - whilst building on our HTML knowledge thus far.

## Live Website

### HTML
The HTML was revised to include a standardised HTML DOCTYPE, which included all relevant meta tags. All div tags were
reviewed to ensure they followed a semantic HTML pattern. This included replacing divs for header, nav, section, article tags and more.
Small changes were also made to aid accessibility and SEO such as changing the <title> and also included a <favicon>. For this project, I also imported Google Fonts to aid with the styling.

### CSS
As some classes were removed for semantic HTML elements, these were then reflected in the CSS. The CSS file itself was also re-organised and labelled to follow
a sequential pattern based on the waterfall of the landing page, to aid other readers to understand what section(s) they need to refer to.
Much of the CSS was repeated so to ensure the file remained DRY, classes were concatenated for ease-of-reference and to group elements semantically.
